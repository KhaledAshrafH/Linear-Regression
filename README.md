# Predicting Car Prices
“car_data.csv” contains 205 records of cars with 25 features per record in addition to 1 target column. These features include the car size and dimensions, the fuel system and fuel type used by the car, the engine size and type, the horsepower, etc. The final column (i.e., the target) is the car price.
